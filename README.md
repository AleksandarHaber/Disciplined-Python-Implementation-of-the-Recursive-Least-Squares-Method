# Disciplined-Python-Implementation-of-the-Recursive-Least-Squares-Method
This is a disciplined Python implementation of the Recursive Least Squares Method. 

## Rationale: Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method is one of the fundamental methods for parameter estimation and control. It is used as the basis of Kalman filtering, adaptive control, recursive subspace identification method, as well as the basis of many other estimation, control, and machine learning methods. 

We created a tutorial that explains how to easily derive the recursive least squares method. The tutorial is given here:

Also, we created a tutorial that explains the Python implementation of the codes posted in this reposity. The tutorial is given here 
https://aleksandarhaber.com/introduction-to-kalman-filter-disciplined-python-implementation-of-recursive-least-squares-method/

In that tutorial, we also provide an example in order to numerically investigate the performance of the recursive least squares method.
